Three files, one for the FramePack auto Installer and two for a manually installed version

1. The Sage installer will install Triton and Sage with no pfaffing around , file should be saved next to the other bat files it has (environment, run and update)

2. The other two bat files are for firstly running a manuallly installed FramePack and secondly for updating it. The files should be saved in the folder above the gradio python file.
